```
A strange game.
The only winning move is not to play.

Description
-----------
This implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe uses a heuristic strategy to effectively play
the game. Instead of using the "traditional" method (i.e. brute forcing the best
move), the AI in this implementation uses an actual strategy to play.
