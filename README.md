Tic Tac Toe
===========
A strange game.

The only winning move is not to play.

Description
-----------
This implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe features a non-brute-force method of playing the game. Instead of using the "traditional" method (i.e. brute forcing the best move), the AI in this implementation uses an actual strategy to play.

As of version 1.0 of this project, I have been unable to defeat the AI. And when the AI plays itself, all games so far have resulted in a tie.
